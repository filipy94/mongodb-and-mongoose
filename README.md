# MongoDB and Mongoose :symbols:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development and APIs studies.


## Functionality :heavy_check_mark:

-  MongoDB is a database application that stores JSON documents (or records) that you can use in your application. Unlike SQL, another type of database, Mongo is a non-relational or "NoSQL" database. This means Mongo stores all associated data within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables as in a SQL database.

- Mongoose is a popular npm package that is often installed alongside Mongo. With Mongoose, you can use plain JavaScript objects instead of JSON, which makes it easier to work with Mongo. Also, it allows you to create blueprints for your documents called schemas, so you don't accidentally save the wrong type of data and cause bugs later.

- In the MongoDB and Mongoose courses, you'll learn the fundamentals of working with persistent data including how to set up a model, and save, delete, and find documents in the database.
